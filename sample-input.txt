By now, the vice chairmanis probably infertile-- if nobody wishes to give away their son, why does he keep trying to abandon Miaomiao?

I think this stopped being a conscious decision. He's just doing it because it became part of his life. I think going outside with Miaomiao helped him understand himself.

The vice chairman is obviously very gullible towards superstitions, fortune telling, and other rumors. He succumbed very quickly to the thought of getting good fortune from keeping Miaomiao, just from hearing it from some neighbors.

Yes and it also proves how easily his actions can be swayed and what his true intentions were with Miaomiao. At first he wanted to abandon her for his benefit and now that they say she's blessed, he keeps her again for his own benefit.

I think it's because back then the only way to carry on the family name and earn more money was to give birth to a son, so the dad is conflicted wether to abandon her and give birth to a son or raise Miaomiao, shown by his contradictory actions.

I think part of him still cares about Miaomiao. I don't think he likes the thought of killing her or just leaving her to die outside. He still cares enough to want to know that she will be safe. I think he only wants to abandon her because he also wants to keep up his appearance. However, I think these two feelings are conflicting. He wants to keep a good appearance, but it's taking so long to abandon Miaomiao that his feelings for her grow stronger.

I feel like part of his feelings are conflicting. Although he tries to abandon his child, he seems to grow closer. It's like love and hate. Both are passionate emotions and are much more similar than people think. He still cares that she's safe and now he's even giving her a birthday meal.

At this point, he probably doesn't even want to use his own judgement because every time he tries to abandon Miaomiao it fails, and so he resorts to taking other people's advice (fortune teller, family planning officer) in hopes that the next time he attempts to leave his daughter, he'll finally succeed.
Leah Uriarte

I think he doesn't directly kill Miaomiao because the fortune teller told him he would only succeed in getting rid of her if he was certain a kindhearted person would take care of her, so he believes any murder attempts will fail.

I think maybe understanding this like men being valued more than women in society could be one example of a problem in the world. Someone who doesn't have knowledge of this like this or someone who can't understand it allows someone to live a life free of these types of worries. Her father on the other hand, has been through so much "trouble" and stress trying to get rid of her (obviously not saying she has not suffered anything but I think her father has been more stressed thinking about what this would do for his legacy or whatever). That is what I think the author means by only they can find happiness. Just a guess tho.

It is unfortunate, because most children prefer open aired, spacious, sunny areas that allow them to play and explore. This interaction with the sensory is very important for their development, but Miaomiao will probably be very uncomfortable in outdoor environments for the rest of her life, because of how much impact this trauma in her development years will affect her.

This really shows how much men from China care about having a son to carry on their last name and legacy, even going as far as to value it more than his own life.

Aishwarya Poolla
Aishwarya Poolla
5:14 PM Aug 19
While I do agree with what is said above, I don't completely agree that it is solely because men are biologically stronger. There were a few cultures that considered women to be "more intelligent," which caused the men to be left out of decision making or dismissed quickly. I think that what cultures tell their children affects how they think more. So like you all said above, the men were considered stronger because they were the farmers and the blacksmiths, but they were also considered stronger because of religious/cultural stories about men being warriors who had to protect the women also played a role in this.

Without reading further, this line already makes me feel like something bad will happen because their daughter was born "not very smart". Not only is their daughter "not very smart", but she is also their only child. Also, there is a reason Chinese people like sons more than daughters: sons can carry their last name on for future generations, but daughters can't. I'm not sure if this is prominent here but even now my parents tell me stories of families who spend years just to have a son to carry down the last name. For example, one family had 5 daughters before birthing a son.

When his second daughter was just two weeks old, he took Miaomiao in his arms and set off for a public park, planning to abandon her there.

It is common with people of high positions, especially people in politics or people that deal with politics. The vice chairman cares much more about how he looks than his family to keep his reputation well and make himself look better.

Well, even though most people don't have that thinking (that only son can carry the family's bloodline down) anymore, most people will still want a son more than a daughter. (I'm not saying worldwide but mostly in Asia and mostly happens in China and Taiwan because it's normal to them in the past)

In Chinese and most other East Asian cultures, men are considered more valuable than women, resulting in parents choosing to abandon their daughters in the past. But because the vice chairman had a daughter who also happened to be disabled, he felt both the shame of having a daughter and having a disabled child.

Well, it's all caused by people in the surroundings keep telling them this so it just keeps passing on, and rarely do people think differently because they are constantly taught about it so it's very normal to them. Like to me, I feel people with that thinking are just out of their mind and that's because my parent and people around me keep telling me that it's not right to think that boys are better than girls and so I think it is right because I was constantly taught with that idea. (sorry it might be hard to understand what I want to say I'm not good at writing things like this so good luck understanding what I want to say)

This statement makes the birth year and blood type having to do something with personality sound like a fact. But as they aren't scientifically proven, it's interesting to see this stated as a fact and like this person's personality won't change (like many other superstitions in the story).

The reason that he's trying to abandon Miaomiao is because they also have another daughter and can't have any more children. Because she's mentally handicapped in addition to being a daughter instead of a son, he doesn't see her as an actual human being and more as a property to give to someone else to make space for another one.

I agree with you based on this current paragraph, but if you read below you can see that this chairman cared enough to drop his daughter off at an orphanage. He doesn't know whether or not the people there will be 'kindhearted', but it's starting to seem like he's caring a bit more for his child, maybe tying in to the fact that he's starting to spend so much time with Miaomiao when trying to find a way to get rid of her.

I think the wife could also be a victim in this case. Her husband clearly views her as inferior because she is a woman, and he speaks of her as if she is some baby factory, not a human being.

Because Miaomiao is now old enough to understand what's going on, she begins to fear the outside world because of her father, and has psychological problems that she must live with for the rest of her life. Her father is willing to go this far just to keep up the family name, which shows that he cares more about reputation than his own child.

Miaomiao may also suffer severe trauma and PTSD.
